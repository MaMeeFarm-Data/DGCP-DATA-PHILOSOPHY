# DGCP — Glossary & Core Definitions  
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## Purpose

This glossary defines **core terms and concepts** used throughout
the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof™) ecosystem.

DGCP terminology is precise by design.
Words here are not metaphors.
They are **operational definitions**.

This document exists to ensure:
- Consistent interpretation
- Legal clarity
- Cross-disciplinary understanding
- Long-term continuity

---

## Core Terms

### DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof™)

A reality-based data governance framework that preserves
real human-origin data through continuous, time-anchored proof.

DGCP prioritizes lived reality over abstract data models.

---

### Data Unit

A human individual recognized as the **origin owner** of
their generated data.

A Data Unit:
- Owns their lived data
- Retains attribution rights
- Cannot be reduced to a data source

Platforms do not own Data Units.

---

### Human-Origin Data (HOD)

Data generated directly from real human activity,
observation, or decision-making.

Examples:
- Daily work records
- Environmental observation
- Physical actions
- Time-anchored documentation

HOD excludes simulated, inferred, or synthetic data.

---

### Real-World Data (RWD)

Human-Origin Data that is:
- Context-preserved
- Time-anchored
- Continuously documented

RWD gains meaning through accumulation, not volume.

---

### Continuous Proof

A method of validating reality through
**repeated documentation over time**.

Single proofs are insufficient.
Truth emerges from continuity.

Continuous Proof is intentionally:
- Boring
- Routine
- Non-performative

---

### Proof Record

An individual documented instance within a
continuous proof chain.

A proof record has meaning only
when linked to prior and future records.

---

### Time Anchor

A temporal reference that situates data
within an irreversible timeline.

Examples:
- Timestamps
- Daily logs
- Sequential commits

Time anchors prevent narrative rewriting.

---

### Proof Chain

A sequence of proof records connected
by time and context.

A proof chain cannot be compressed
without loss of truth.

---

### Proof Before Narrative

A DGCP principle stating that
storytelling must never precede
or override documented reality.

Narratives may explain proof.
They may not replace it.

---

### Reality-Based Data

Data that originates from lived experience
rather than abstraction, simulation, or optimization.

Reality-based data accepts imperfection
as a feature, not a flaw.

---

### Platform Neutrality

The principle that DGCP is not bound
to any platform, technology, or storage medium.

Reality exists independently of hosting.

---

### Attribution Integrity

The requirement that all DGCP-related use
preserves origin, context, and continuity.

Fragmented attribution is a violation.

---

### Continuous Governance

A governance model where validation
emerges from time, repetition, and transparency
rather than authority or declaration.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If a term is ambiguous:
1. Human dignity prevails
2. Continuity prevails
3. Time prevails

DGCP chooses reality over convenience.

---

## Living Document Notice

This glossary may expand over time.
Definitions may clarify,
but core meanings must remain stable.

Backward compatibility of meaning
is mandatory.
