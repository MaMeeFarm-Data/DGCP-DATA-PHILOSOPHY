# DGCP — 6-Month Roadmap (Intent-Based)
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## Purpose

This roadmap outlines the **intentional direction** of DGCP
(Data Governance & Continuous Proof™) over a six-month horizon.

This is not a delivery schedule.
This is not a promise.
This is not a funding plan.

It is a **statement of continuity**.

DGCP values time-validated reality over rapid execution.

---

## Guiding Principle

> DGCP grows by accumulation, not acceleration.

Each phase exists to allow reality,
proof, and interpretation to mature naturally.

---

## Month 1–2: Foundation Stabilization

Intent:
- Allow philosophical and legal foundations to settle
- Observe interpretation without intervention

Focus:
- README, Philosophy, License, Index, Scope, Glossary
- Daily proof continuity (outside this repository)
- No expansion pressure

Outcome:
- Stable conceptual reference point
- Clear public intent
- Early signal filtering

---

## Month 3–4: Proof Density Accumulation

Intent:
- Increase time depth rather than feature breadth

Focus:
- Continuous proof records
- Daily logs and lived-data documentation
- Strengthening proof chains

Outcome:
- Thicker time anchors
- Reduced narrative ambiguity
- Reality speaks louder than explanation

---

## Month 5: Structural Readiness

Intent:
- Prepare for interpretation at scale
- Without forcing adoption

Focus:
- Optional specification drafts
- Clarification of proof methodologies
- Internal consistency review

Outcome:
- DGCP becomes easier to understand
- Without becoming simplified

---

## Month 6: Visibility Without Promotion

Intent:
- Allow external recognition to emerge organically

Focus:
- Observation of external references
- Monitoring misuse or misinterpretation
- No active marketing

Outcome:
- Natural alignment with the right audiences
- Clear boundary enforcement if needed

---

## What This Roadmap Explicitly Avoids

- Feature-driven deadlines
- Growth metrics
- Virality strategies
- Forced partnerships
- Premature commercialization

DGCP does not rush legitimacy.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Continuity of proof
- Clarity of interpretation
- Stability of definitions
- Respect for Data Units

Not by numbers.

---

## Living Roadmap Notice

This roadmap may evolve,
but its **time-respecting nature must remain unchanged**.

DGCP does not chase the future.
It lets the future arrive.
