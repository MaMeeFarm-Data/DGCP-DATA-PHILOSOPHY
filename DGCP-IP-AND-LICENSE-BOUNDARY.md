## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **intellectual property (IP) scope, license
boundary, and usage conditions** for DGCP — Data Governance &
Continuous Proof™.

DGCP exists to protect **real human-origin data**, continuous proof
records, and lived-data philosophies from misuse, extraction,
misrepresentation, or unauthorized commercialization.

This is a boundary document.
Not a sales license.
Not a platform policy.
Not an open-data waiver.

## 2. What DGCP Covers

DGCP governs the following categories of intellectual property:

1. **Philosophical Frameworks**
   - DGCP principles, manifestos, definitions, and governance concepts
   - Data Unit, Continuous Proof, Real-World Data (RWD)

2. **Structural Documentation**
   - README files, specifications, whitepapers, indices, and schemas
   - Repository structures and naming conventions

3. **Proof Methodology**

4. **Human-Origin Data Context**

It governs the **framework under which data continuity is documented
and protected**.
