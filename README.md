# DGCP — Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

DGCP is not a product.  
Not a platform.  
Not a blockchain experiment.

DGCP is a **philosophy of reality-based data governance**.

It exists to answer one question:

> How do we preserve truth in a world flooded with synthetic data?

---

## What DGCP Is

DGCP treats **real human activity** as the highest-quality data source.

- Daily work
- Environmental observation
- Human decisions
- Physical actions
- Lived experience

All recorded through **continuous proof**, not isolated claims.

---

## What DGCP Is Not

- Not surveillance
- Not data extraction
- Not attention economy
- Not speculative NFT hype
- Not trust-based storytelling

DGCP requires **proof over time**, not belief.

---

## Core Principles

- Reality > Narrative
- Continuity > Virality
- Proof > Promise
- Human-first data ownership
- Time as the ultimate validator

---

## Why DGCP Matters

AI systems are not failing because they lack intelligence.  
They are failing because they lack **ground truth**.

DGCP provides **Real-World Data (RWD)**:
- Low-noise
- Time-anchored
- Human-origin
- Tamper-resistant by design
