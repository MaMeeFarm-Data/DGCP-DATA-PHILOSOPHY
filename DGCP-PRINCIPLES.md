# DGCP — Core Principles  
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **core principles** of DGCP
(Data Governance & Continuous Proof™).

These principles are non-negotiable.
They guide interpretation, implementation, and governance
across all DGCP-related work.

DGCP may evolve.
These principles must remain stable.

---

## Principle 1: Reality Over Abstraction

DGCP prioritizes lived reality over models, simulations,
or optimized representations.

If reality and abstraction conflict,
reality prevails.

---

## Principle 2: Proof Before Narrative

Narratives may explain reality.
They must never replace it.

Documentation precedes storytelling.

---

## Principle 3: Continuity Creates Truth

Single data points are insufficient.

Truth emerges through repeated,
time-linked documentation.

---

## Principle 4: Humans Are Data Units, Not Resources

Humans are origin owners of their data,
not extractable inputs.

Data dignity is fundamental.

---

## Principle 5: Time Is the Ultimate Auditor

Validation does not come from authority,
but from sustained presence over time.

Time cannot be gamed.

---

## Principle 6: Platforms Do Not Own Reality

Hosting, indexing, or displaying data
does not grant ownership.

Reality exists independently of platforms.

---

## Principle 7: Slow by Design

DGCP rejects speed as a proxy for value.

Slowness protects truth.

---

## Principle 8: Technology Is Optional, Integrity Is Not

DGCP is technology-neutral.

Any tool used must preserve continuity,
auditability, and human dignity.

---

## Principle 9: Attribution Is Mandatory

Context, origin, and continuity
must always be preserved.

Fragmentation is distortion.

---

## Principle 10: Proof Exists Without Tokens

Financial instruments may reference proof.
They must never replace it.

Truth is not scarce.

---

## Principle 11: Governance Emerges, It Is Not Declared

Authority does not create truth.
Accumulation does.

Governance follows proof.

---

## Principle 12: Boundaries Protect Meaning

Clear scope and license boundaries
protect DGCP from misuse and dilution.

Not everything that can be done
should be done.

---

## Closing Statement

DGCP does not promise certainty.
It preserves honesty.

Those who accept imperfection
will understand DGCP.
