# DGCP — Ecosystem Index  
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## Purpose of This Index

This document serves as the **authoritative index and navigation map**
for the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof™) ecosystem.

DGCP is intentionally distributed across multiple repositories.
This index defines how each repository relates, scopes, and aligns
under a single philosophical and governance framework.

This is not a technical dependency map.
It is a **conceptual and governance map**.

---

## Core Philosophy Layer (Root)

### 1. DGCP-DATA-PHILOSOPHY  
**Status:** Root Repository

Purpose:
- Defines DGCP philosophy and manifesto
- Establishes data-first (human-origin) framing
- Serves as the conceptual entry point for all DGCP work

Key Files:
- README.md
- DGCP-PHILOSOPHY.md
- LICENSE.md
- INDEX.md (this file)

---

## Governance & Legal Layer

### 2. DGCP-IP / LICENSE (Embedded Across Repos)

Purpose:
- Protects real human-origin data
- Defines attribution, usage, and restriction boundaries
- Acts as the legal spine of DGCP

Standard File:
- LICENSE.md (DGCP | MMFARM-POL License)

This license must be present in **every DGCP-related repository**.

---

## Specification Layer (Planned / Active)

### 3. DGCP-SPEC

Purpose:
- Defines formal specifications without enforcing implementation
- Neutral to technology, platform, or jurisdiction

Typical Content:
- Definitions
- Schemas
- Proof logic descriptions
- Terminology standards

---

## Proof & Reality Layer

### 4. DGCP-PROOF / DAILY / RWD Repositories

Purpose:
- Capture real human-origin data
- Preserve continuous proof over time
- Anchor DGCP to lived reality

Content Examples:
- Daily logs
- Proof records
- Time-anchored documentation
- Environmental and work observations

This layer is where **DGCP becomes real**.

---

## Creative & Cultural Layer (Optional)

### 5. DGCP-CREATIVE / MEDIA / NARRATIVE

Purpose:
- Preserve human stories tied to real data
- Allow cultural expression without breaking proof integrity

Notes:
- Creative output does not replace proof
- Narrative must not override continuity

---

## NFT / Token Boundary Layer (Conditional)

### 6. DGCP-NFT / TOKEN REFERENCES

Purpose:
- Optional anchoring or referencing mechanism
- Must never replace or override proof
- NFTs are references, not reality

Rule:
> Proof exists independently of tokens.

---

## External Adoption Layer (Future)

### 7. DGCP-ADOPTION / PARTNERS

Potential Scope:
- Research institutions
- Governments
- AI companies
- Community nodes

All external adoption must:
- Respect LICENSE.md
- Preserve Data Unit dignity
- Maintain proof continuity

---

## Principles of Ecosystem Design

- No single repository owns DGCP
- Philosophy precedes implementation
- Proof precedes narrative
- Data Units precede platforms
- Time precedes validation

DGCP grows by **accumulation**, not expansion.

---

## How to Use This Index

- Start with DGCP-DATA-PHILOSOPHY
- Respect LICENSE.md at all times
- Do not fragment context
- Build slowly and continuously

DGCP is not fast by design.
