# DGCP — Changelog
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

This changelog records **meaningful conceptual, philosophical,
and governance-level changes** within the DGCP ecosystem.

DGCP does not change frequently.
When it does, changes are intentional, documented,
and anchored in time.

This is not a software release log.
This is a **continuity of meaning record**.

## [Unreleased]

Reserved for future conceptual clarifications or boundary updates.
Minor editorial changes are not logged here.

## Change Philosophy

DGCP changelog entries must meet at least one of the following:
- Clarify meaning
- Protect human data dignity
- Strengthen continuity
- Prevent misuse or misinterpretation

Changes for speed, popularity, or trend alignment
are explicitly rejected.

---

## Versioning Approach

DGCP uses **time-based versioning**, not semantic versioning.

Time, not features, determines maturity.

---

## Governance of Changes

- Changes must be documented
- Changes must preserve backward meaning compatibility
- Changes must respect LICENSE.md
- Silence does not imply acceptance

DGCP evolves carefully.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If conflict arises between documents:
1. LICENSE.md prevails
2. PHILOSOPHY prevails
3. PRINCIPLES prevail
4. TIME prevails
