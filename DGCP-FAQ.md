# DGCP — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## What is DGCP in simple terms?

DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof™) is a framework for
preserving **real human-origin data** through continuous,
time-anchored documentation.

It is not a platform, product, or database.
It is a way to let **reality validate itself over time**.

---

## Is DGCP a technology or a protocol?

No.

DGCP is **technology-neutral**.
It does not require blockchain, AI, tokens, or any specific system.

Technologies may support DGCP,
but they do not define it.

Reality is the protocol.

---

## Why does DGCP emphasize “continuous” proof?

Because isolated evidence is easy to manipulate.

DGCP relies on:
- Repetition
- Time
- Context

Truth is not proven once.
It is demonstrated continuously.

---

## Is DGCP open source?

No.

DGCP is **open to reference**, but **not open for unrestricted use**.

All content is governed under:
**DGCP | MMFARM-POL License (2025)**

Attribution is mandatory.
Commercial or extractive use requires explicit permission.

---

## Who owns the data in DGCP?

The **Data Unit** (the human who generated the data)
retains ownership of their human-origin data.

DGCP governs the **framework and methodology**,
not ownership of a person’s life.

Platforms do not own reality.

---

## Can DGCP be used for AI training?

Only with explicit, written authorization.

DGCP rejects:
- Silent data extraction
- Assumed consent
- Large-scale scraping

Human dignity and context preservation
are non-negotiable.

---

## Is DGCP limited to farming or agriculture?

No.

DGCP originated from lived agricultural work,
but it applies to **any real human activity**:
- Craft
- Care work
- Research
- Daily labor
- Environmental observation

Where humans live and work, DGCP can exist.

---

## Does DGCP require NFTs or tokens?

No.

Tokens or NFTs may reference DGCP proof,
but they must never replace or override reality.

Proof exists independently of financial instruments.

---

## Why is DGCP intentionally slow?

Because speed optimizes for output,
not truth.

DGCP uses time as a validator.
Slowness protects continuity,
context, and integrity.

---

## Can organizations or governments adopt DGCP?

Potentially, yes.

But adoption must:
- Respect LICENSE.md
- Preserve Data Unit dignity
- Avoid surveillance or coercive use

DGCP is permission-aware, not permissionless.

---

## What happens if DGCP is misused or misinterpreted?

Misuse that violates:
- Scope
- License
- Attribution
- Human dignity

Is considered **out of scope and unauthorized**.

DGCP relies on documentation and time,
not enforcement theater.

---

## Is DGCP finished?

No.

DGCP is **alive by design**.

Its foundations are stable,
but its proof grows daily.

DGCP does not rush completion.
It accumulates meaning.

---

## Where should new readers start?

1. README.md  
2. DGCP-PHILOSOPHY.md  
3. LICENSE.md  
4. INDEX.md  

Everything else builds from there.
