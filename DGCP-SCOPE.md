# DGCP — Scope & Boundaries  
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof™

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **scope of applicability and limitations**
of DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof™).

DGCP is a framework for preserving **real human-origin data**
through continuous, time-anchored proof.

This file exists to prevent:
- Misuse
- Overextension
- Misinterpretation
- Premature commercialization

---

## What DGCP Is Designed For

DGCP is designed to govern and preserve:

1. **Real Human Activity**
   - Daily work
   - Physical actions
   - Environmental observation
   - Lived decision-making

2. **Continuous Proof Systems**
   - Repeated documentation over time
   - Non-performative, routine records
   - Boring, honest, verifiable data

3. **Human-Origin Data (HOD)**
   - Data generated directly by humans
   - Data tied to real environments
   - Data with temporal continuity

4. **Data Unit-Centric Governance**
   - Humans as owners of their data
   - Platforms as hosts, not owners
   - Proof before narrative

---

## What DGCP Is Not Designed For

DGCP is **not** intended for:

- High-frequency financial trading data
- Behavioral surveillance systems
- Mass consumer analytics
- Advertising or attention optimization
- Psychological profiling
- Synthetic data generation
- Simulation-first data pipelines

DGCP rejects:
> “Scale first, explain later.”

---

## Non-Goals of DGCP

DGCP explicitly does not aim to:

- Replace all data systems
- Compete with traditional databases
- Optimize for speed or virality
- Act as a centralized authority
- Enforce a single implementation model

DGCP values **truth continuity over efficiency**.

---

## Technology Neutrality

DGCP is technology-neutral.

It does not mandate:
- Blockchain usage
- Specific storage solutions
- Tokenization
- AI integration
- Cloud infrastructure

Any technology used must:
- Preserve continuity
- Respect human data dignity
- Remain auditable over time

---

## Geographic & Cultural Scope

DGCP is globally applicable.

It respects:
- Local context
- Cultural practices
- Language diversity
- Jurisdictional variation

Reality is local.
Truth is universal.

---

## Time Horizon

DGCP operates on **long time horizons**.

- Short-term proof has limited meaning
- Medium-term continuity builds credibility
- Long-term accumulation creates truth

DGCP is slow by design.

---

## Relationship to Tokens and NFTs

Tokens or NFTs may reference DGCP data,
but they must never:

- Replace proof
- Override reality
- Compress context
- Create artificial scarcity of truth

Proof exists independently of financial instruments.

---

## Misuse Clause

Any application of DGCP that:

- Distorts lived reality
- Exploits human data
- Breaks attribution continuity
- Violates the LICENSE.md

Is considered **out of scope** and unauthorized.

---

## Interpretation Rule

In cases of ambiguity:

1. Human dignity prevails
2. Proof continuity prevails
3. Time prevails

DGCP chooses reality over convenience.
